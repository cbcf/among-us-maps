# Unofficial Among Us maps
I created these overview maps to spend my time being a ghost while playing this the well known game with some friends. 
They can be quite helpful during discussions, especially for new players, as you cannot view the in-game map during discussions.
The maps are a hobby project only and neither official nor related to the game creators. 

Please feel free to share these and add issues if you'd like to see more detailed versions or spot any "bugs".
