# Unofficial Among Us maps
I created these overview maps to spend my time being a ghost while playing this the well known game with some friends. 
They can be quite helpful during discussions, especially for new players, as you cannot view the in-game map during discussions.
The maps are a hobby project only and neither official nor related to the game creators. 

*Now including the new [Airship map](#the-airship) (spring 2021)!*

Each of the redrawn Among Us map includes:
- Vents and vent network connections
- Location of cameras or sensors and meeting button
- Location of lockable doors
- Room names
- Emergency fixing locations
- Other points of interest for orientation

Please feel free to share these and add issues if you'd like to see more detailed versions or spot any "bugs".
